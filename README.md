# Transformers Practice Project ðŸ¤–

Hey! I'm a CS grad who's learning about transformers for fun and to prep for future AI/ML jobs. This repo is basically my playground for experimenting with transformer models.

## What's This About?

I'm experimenting with transformer models (like BERT/GPT) and just learning by doing! It's been a cool journey so far.

## What's Covered

- **Models I'm trying out:**
  - BERT (text understanding)
  - GPT (text generation)
  - T5 (text-to-text tasks)
  - RoBERTa, DistilBERT, and a few others

- **Tasks I'm working on:**
  - Text classification and sentiment analysis
  - Named Entity Recognition (NER)
  - Question answering
  - Text summarization
  - Fine-tuning pre-trained models

## Setup

Pretty straightforward:

```bash
pip install torch transformers
```

You might also need:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

## How to Run

Just check out the main script:

```bash
python transformers_practice.py
```

Or explore the notebooks if you prefer that!

## Honest Note

This isn't perfectâ€”I'm just figuring stuff out as I go. If you have suggestions or want to contribute, feel free! Always happy to learn from others.
